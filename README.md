# Obsidian MCP Server ðŸ§ 

A Ruby-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Obsidian vaults. Built with [fast-mcp](https://github.com/yjacquin/fast-mcp), this server allows AI models to search, read, and analyze your evergreen notes.

## Features

- **Search Notes**: Find notes by content, title, or tags
- **Read Individual Notes**: Get full note content including frontmatter and links
- **List All Notes**: Browse all notes with metadata
- **Tag-based Filtering**: Find notes by specific tags
- **Vault Statistics**: Get comprehensive statistics about your vault
- **Tag Cloud**: Analyze tag usage patterns

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd obsidian-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```

3. Set your vault path (optional):
```bash
export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
./obsidian_server.rb
```

The server will automatically discover your vault using these methods:
1. `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` environment variable
2. Default test notes in `../obsidian-test-notes/notes`
3. Other common relative paths

### Available Tools

#### 1. Search Notes
Search for notes by query text in titles, tags, or content.

#### 2. Read Note
Read the full content of a specific note by filename or title.

#### 3. List Notes
Get a list of all notes in the vault with basic metadata.

#### 4. Find by Tags
Find notes that contain specific tags with flexible matching options.

### Available Resources

#### 1. Vault Statistics
Access comprehensive statistics about your vault:
- Total notes and words
- Average words per note
- Unique tags count
- Internal and external link counts

#### 2. Tag Cloud
Get tag usage statistics and counts across your vault.

## Configuration

Set environment variables to customize the server:

- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`: Path to your Obsidian vault
- `OBSIDIAN_MCP_SERVER_NAME`: Custom server name (default: "obsidian-vault-server")
- `OBSIDIAN_MCP_SERVER_VERSION`: Custom server version (default: "1.0.0")

## Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular architecture:

â””â”€â”€ obsidian_mcp.rb           # Main module
```

## Testing with MCP Inspector

You can test the server using the official MCP inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector ./obsidian_server.rb
```

## Integration with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
